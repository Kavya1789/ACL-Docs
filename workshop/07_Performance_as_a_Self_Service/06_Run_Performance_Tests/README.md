# Run Performance Test on Carts Service

In this lab you'll trigger a performance test for (1) the current implementation of carts and (2) a new version of the carts service. The new version of the carts intentionally contains a slow down of the service, which should be detected by the performance validation.

## Step 1: Run Performance Test on current Implementation

1. Go to  **Jenkins** and click on **sockshop** folder.
1. Click on **carts.performance**.
1. Click on **Build Now** to trigger the performance pipeline.

## Step 2: Introduce a slowdown in the Carts Service

1. In the directory of `carts\`, open the file: `carts\src\main\resources\application.properties`.
1. Change the value of `delayInMillis` from `0` to `1000`.
1. Commit/Push the changes to your GitHub Repository *carts*.

## Step 3: Build this new Version

1. Go to **Jenkins** and click on the **sockshop** folder.
1. Click on **carts** and select the **master** branch.
1. Click on **Build Now** to trigger the pipeline.
1. Wait until the pipeline shows: *Success*.

## Step 4: Run Performance Test on new Version

1. Go to **Jenkins** and click on the **sockshop** folder.
1. Click on **carts.performance** and select the **master** branch.  
1. Click on **Build Now** to trigger the performance pipeline.

## Step 5: Review Performance Signature Plugin Configuration

1. Review the Jenkinsfile.performance perfSigDynatraceReports step:

    ```
    perfSigDynatraceReports(
        envId: 'Dynatrace Tenant', 
        nonFunctionalFailure: 1, 
        specFile: "monspec/${env.APP_NAME}_perfsig.json"
    ```

1. In this case the pipeline will be marked as unstable due to the nonFunctionalFailure parameter being set to 1.

- This parameter has 3 possible values:
    - 0: donâ€™t impact the build state
    - 1: mark the build as unstable
    - 2: mark the build as failed

## Step 6: Explore Results in Jenkins

1. After a successful pipeline execution, click on **Performance Trend**. 
This opens a trend analysis of the jMeter test results. In more details, it shows a chart for the throughput, response time, and percentage of errors as shown below.

1. Click on **Performance Signature**.
There you get an overview of the last builds similar to the screenshot below.

1. Click on the **Build No** of one particular build and click on **Performance Signature**.
This opens a detailed view about the performance validation of the selected build.
